# relational_magnitude_judgement

[Rob's example](https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu//rgoldsto/curvemorph/bezier-curve2.html)

[Our experiment page](https://lingsyrina.github.io/psychmag.html)

The magnitude experiment page (psychmag.html) calls the canvasMorpher.js for morph generation. 


To-do:
1. Code for high precision, no scale conditions;
2. switch A, B labels;
3. Change the test case so that there are more difficult conditions.
